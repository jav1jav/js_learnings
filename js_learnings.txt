h2. Objects - 
keys are always stored as strings
you can't use . notation with a variable. you just can't.
literal notation refers to defining an object by listing the key pairs between {}



h2. Accessing Methods
the format is always object.method or array.method
there are times when you go Array.method(arr) and Object.method(obj) but the things that you have been confused about are usually ok if you stick with obj.method or arr.method. 


h2. Common mistakes you need to stop;
* don't forget declaring let or var for the index variable in the for loop declaration section
* don't forget putting parenz around the conditional in the if statments
* iterating through and object and then using the . notation with the 'key' index value
* you cant console.log an Object like you can an array. You have to JSON.stringify(obj)

h2. Functions
* functions without a return statement return undefined


h2. When things are undefined when they are something else
* functions without a return statement return undefined
* accessing array value outside the index is undefined
* array.indexOf(val) returns -1 if the value isn't in the array
* using . notation with an object key when that key is an index in a for-in loop - that value is undefined
